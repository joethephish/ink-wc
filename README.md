# ink word counter

**Note that since I made this project, I've added this as an official feature to both [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky) (via Story -> Word Count and more) and the [ink compiler](https://github.com/inkle/ink) (pass `-s` on command line), though at the time of writing I haven't done an official new release.**

Count number of words in an [ink](https://www.github.com/inkle/ink) project.

Usage: `./ink-wc pathToMyRootFilename.ink`

Leveraging the official ink parser itself, find all the text objects after parsing, and count the number of words across all of them.

The main code is in Program.cs, and you can head to the releases page to download a copy of the command line tool, generated by dotnet.
