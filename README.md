# ink word counter

Count number of words in an [ink](https://www.github.com/inkle/ink) project.

Usage: `./ink-wc pathToMyRootFilename.ink`

Leveraging the official ink parser itself, find all the text objects after parsing, and count the number of words across all of them.

The main code is in Program.cs, and you can head to the releases page to download a copy of the command line tool, generated by dotnet.
